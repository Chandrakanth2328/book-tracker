   cd book-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your PostgreSQL connection details:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/book_tracker
     ```
   - Run the `schema.sql` file to create the `books` table and insert sample data:
     ```bash
     psql -U your_username -d book_tracker -f database/schema.sql
     ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
